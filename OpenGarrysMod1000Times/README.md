# Startup-Millenium
This project was made so I could get an achievement in a game called garrysmod. Startup-Millenium opens and closes you garrysmod at specific times in order for steam to register the game as open. It is capable of searching drives if the game isn't found on the `C:\` drive and comes with an expected wait time of around 25 - 35 seconds depending on computer hardware.
