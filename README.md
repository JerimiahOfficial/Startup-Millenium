# Startup-Millenium
Dir: The program will defualt to the C:\ Drive for steams directory

This project was made so I could get an achievement in a game called garrysmod, sometimes it'll tell you to run it as administrator in order for it to work so, do so. The exe can be found under Bin/Debug/Startup_Millenium.exe, When you build the source other wise it won't be there. you can build the source in debug or release mode it doesn't really matter.
